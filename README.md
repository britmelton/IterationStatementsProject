# IterationStatementsProject
            
            This was an in class exercise to practice Iteration Statements.
            
            
            TODO - Read each comment and complete its instruction
            1.Create a List called "numbers" - DONE!
            2.Create a variable of type int and name it num, initialize the variable with a value of 0          
            3.Create a do-while loop:
                - Increment num by 1
                - Then add num to the collection - numbers
                - While your variable is less than 100
             4.Create a while loop, While num is less than 200
                -Increment num by 1
                -Then add num to the collection numbers
            5.Create a foreach loop using the collection - numbers
                  -In the scope of the foreach loop, print each number in numbers
             6. Create a for loop - this will print the numbers in reverse order - from 200 to 1
                  -in your initializer set the value of i to 199
                  -in your conditional, as long as i is less than or equal to the amount of items in "numbers" AND as long as i is greater than or equal to 0, Decrement i by 1
